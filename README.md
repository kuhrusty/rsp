# RSP

This is just some [BGG RSP](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/guild/3770) stuff.
The main reason this is here is so that I could have some log of changes to
[the rules](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2447516), which is a forum
post and therefore doesn't have the revision history that a wiki page would
have.

**If you're an RSP moderator**, then after you edit that rules post, then
paste it into [rules.txt](rules.txt), or tell
[kuhrusty](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/kuhrusty) to pick up your
changes.


## Other RSP Stuff

* [Meat's RSP archive](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2443018)
* [Some scripts](rsp-backup/README.md) for stuffing Meat's RSP archive into a
  database
